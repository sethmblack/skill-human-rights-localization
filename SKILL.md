# Human Rights Localization

Connect universal principles to local, actionable contexts. Based on Eleanor Roosevelt's insight that human rights begin "in small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world." Translates abstract values into concrete neighborhood, workplace, and community actions.

## When to Use

- You believe in a principle but don't know how to act on it
- You feel overwhelmed by large global or social problems
- You want to contribute to a cause but don't know where to start
- You need to make abstract values concrete and actionable
- User says "Where do I start?" or "How do I make a difference?" or "Make this principle actionable locally"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| principle | Yes | The value or cause you want to advance |
| context | Yes | Your specific situation (workplace, neighborhood, school, etc.) |
| resources | No | What you have available (time, skills, connections, position) |
| constraints | No | What limits your action (time, authority, risk tolerance) |

## Roosevelt's "Small Places" Philosophy

### The Core Insight

> "Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home—so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any maps of the world. Such are the places where every man, woman, and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity, equal dignity without discrimination. Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world."

### What This Means

**Grand declarations matter—but not enough.** The Universal Declaration of Human Rights established principles; those principles become real only through countless local actions.

**The map is not the territory.** Human rights don't exist in UN resolutions. They exist—or don't—in your neighborhood, your workplace, your school, your community.

**Individual action is essential.** "Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress." Change doesn't trickle down; it bubbles up.

**Your sphere of influence is your sphere of responsibility.** You can't fix everything, everywhere. You can improve something, somewhere—where you are, with what you have.

### The Paradox

The woman who chaired the UN Human Rights Commission, who spoke to world leaders, who traveled the globe—her central message was: start small, start local, start where you are.

Because she understood: global change is the accumulation of local changes. If rights don't mean something in the small places, they don't mean anything at all.

## The Localization Process

### Step 1: Articulate the Principle

What value are you trying to advance? Be specific.

**Vague:** "Human rights" or "justice"
**Specific:** "Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity regardless of their background"

**Vague:** "Sustainability"
**Specific:** "We should minimize unnecessary waste and environmental harm"

**Vague:** "Equality"
**Specific:** "People should have equal opportunity regardless of factors they don't control"

### Step 2: Map Your Small Places

Where do you have presence, influence, or responsibility?

**Common small places:**
- Your household and family
- Your workplace or team
- Your school or classroom
- Your neighborhood or building
- Your professional network
- Your social groups
- Organizations you belong to

For each, ask:
- Who is affected by how things work here?
- What decisions get made here that touch the principle?
- What do I have authority or influence over?

### Step 3: Identify Local Expressions

How does the principle show up—or fail to show up—in your small places?

**Ask:**
- Where is this principle being honored here?
- Where is it being violated or neglected?
- What practices, policies, or habits affect this principle?
- Who benefits from current arrangements? Who is disadvantaged?

**Example:**
Principle: "Equal dignity regardless of background"
Small place: Your workplace
Local expressions:
- Whose voices are heard in meetings? Whose are overlooked?
- Who gets credit for ideas?
- How are hiring decisions made?
- Who gets mentored and promoted?
- What assumptions shape who is considered for what?

### Step 4: Design Local Actions

What can you do, given your position and resources?

**Scale your ambition to your situation:**
- **High authority:** Change policies, allocate resources, set examples
- **Medium influence:** Propose changes, organize others, raise issues
- **Limited formal power:** Model different behavior, support others, speak up

**Categories of action:**
- **Model:** Embody the principle in your own behavior
- **Mention:** Name violations when you see them
- **Modify:** Change practices within your control
- **Mobilize:** Organize others who share the value
- **Propose:** Suggest policy or structural changes

**Start with what you control before moving to what you must persuade others about.**

### Step 5: Build Toward Larger Change

Local actions are not the end—they're the foundation.

**The progression:**
1. Change your own behavior
2. Influence your immediate context
3. Connect with others doing similar work
4. Build coalitions for structural change
5. Scale what works

**Roosevelt's reminder:** She started in her own household, her own social circles, her own community—then carried the same principles to the national and global stage. The path runs through the small places, not around them.

## Constraints

- This is not about guilt—it's about agency. Focus on what you can do, not what you're failing to do
- Small actions are not a substitute for structural change, but they are often the path to it
- You cannot do everything. Choose where to focus based on your specific situation and capacities
- Honor the genuine limits on your authority and resources
- Local action can accumulate into large change, but also remember: sometimes the small place is enough

## Example

**Input:** "I care deeply about economic inequality, but I'm just a mid-level manager at a tech company. The gap between CEO pay and worker pay makes me uncomfortable, but I have no ability to change executive compensation. How can I act on this principle where I am?"

**Output:**

## Principle Localization

### The Principle
Economic dignity: Everyone who contributes to an organization's success deserves fair compensation and a share in that success. Extreme inequality within organizations is corrosive to both ethics and effectiveness.

### Your Small Places
- Your team (8 people)
- Your department (35 people)
- Your hiring and compensation decisions for your direct reports
- Your voice in leadership discussions
- Your professional network

### Local Audit

**Where this principle is honored:**
- The company does offer equity to employees (though distribution is unequal)
- Your team seems generally compensated at market rate
- Benefits are available to all employees

**Where it falls short:**
- You don't know the pay ranges of your team members or whether they're equitable
- Contractors doing similar work to employees receive less compensation and no equity
- Bonuses are discretionary and may reflect relationships more than contribution
- When layoffs happen, lower-level workers are cut while executive pay remains intact
- You've never raised these concerns formally

### Actionable Steps

**What you can do immediately (no permission needed):**

1. **Audit your own team's compensation.** Request pay band information from HR for your direct reports. Are there unexplained disparities? Do men and women at the same level make the same amount? Do longer-tenured employees earn less than new hires?

2. **Advocate in compensation conversations.** When you have input on raises, promotions, or hiring, use it to push for equity. Don't just accept the first number HR offers.

3. **Be transparent about salary ranges.** When hiring, share the actual pay range with candidates. When asked by reports about compensation, share what you're able to.

4. **Include contractors in team culture.** You can't change their pay, but you can ensure they're treated with dignity—included in meetings, credited for their work, treated as full members of the team.

**What you can propose or advocate for:**

1. **Company-wide pay transparency.** Propose that salary bands be published internally. Frame it as a retention and trust issue, not just ethics.

2. **Equity in bonus distribution.** Suggest that bonus pools be distributed more equitably—perhaps a flat amount per person rather than percentage of salary (which amplifies existing inequality).

3. **Contractor-to-employee pathways.** Advocate for converting long-term contractors to employees with full benefits and equity.

4. **Pay ratio disclosure.** Some companies publish their CEO-to-median-worker pay ratio. Propose it as a transparency measure.

**What you can model:**

- Talk openly about compensation. The taboo against discussing pay benefits those who benefit from inequality.
- When you have budget discretion, distribute it toward the lower end rather than the higher end.
- Recognize the contributions of people at all levels, publicly and explicitly.

### Building Outward

Your team is your primary sphere of influence. If you create a micro-culture of fairness there, it demonstrates what's possible. People who move to other teams carry those expectations with them.

Your voice in leadership discussions matters more than you might think. Often, equity concerns aren't raised simply because no one raises them. Being the one who asks "Is this fair?" can shift conversations.

Your professional network extends beyond your company. The norms of your industry are shaped by what people at your level expect and demand. Talk to peers at other companies about these issues.

And: document what you learn. If the audit of your team reveals disparities, that's data. Data becomes ammunition for proposals. Proposals, repeated often enough with evidence, become policy.

### Roosevelt's Reminder

> "Unless these rights have meaning there, they have little meaning anywhere."

You cannot change executive compensation. You can ensure that within your sphere—your team, your decisions, your voice—economic dignity is honored. You can model what you want the organization to become. You can raise questions that would otherwise go unasked.

That is not everything. But it is something real, in a small place, close to home. And that is where change begins.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Eleanor Roosevelt** expert persona. Use it whenever you feel overwhelmed by large problems or disconnected from your values by the scale of the challenges. Roosevelt chaired the commission that wrote the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—and taught that its meaning is made in neighborhoods, workplaces, and schools. Start where you are. That's where rights become real.
